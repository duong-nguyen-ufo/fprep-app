Every time I do meal prep, it's like a marathon. I want to save myself time, so I wrote this app for my own use. If you're also someone who has to do meal prep every week, I hope you find this useful too.

The goal of the app is to make meal prep as efficient as possible, from planning to cooking the meals. The cooking instructions should show you step by step how to cook multiple dishes for the desired quantities with little waiting while utilizing the kitchen equipment you have.
